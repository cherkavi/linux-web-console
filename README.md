# Easy Cloud Shell

Easy to use web based file manager with built in text editor, terminal, image viewer and video player

<h4>What is it and how can it be useful to you?</h4>
<p>
It is an web based file manager and terminal emulator, with some built in tools like tabbed text editor, search and image/video player.
It can be useful to you if you want to access/manage/deploy apps on a remote linux server from your desktop and mobile browser. You can create/edit/manage/search files in multiple tabs, 
run commands using built in terminal, and view images and videos, all from your browser. Setting it up on server is also very easy, as it generates and configure itself to use self signed certificate for ssl.
